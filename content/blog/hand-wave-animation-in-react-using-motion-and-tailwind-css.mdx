Thoughtful micro-interactions can transform a static interface into something more welcoming and human. In this project, I built a hand-wave animation component using React, Motion, and Tailwind CSS to demonstrate how subtle motion can improve user experience without overwhelming the design.

In this post, we’ll create a reusable animated SVG component using Motion to handle animation states and transitions.

## Objective

- Animate a standard SVG icon using Motion
- Keep the animation smooth and natural
- Make the component reusable across different parts of an application

## Tech Stack

- `Next.js` App Router
- `Motion` for animation control
- `Tailwind` CSS for styling and sizing
- `SVG` for scalable, crisp visuals

## Component Structure

The animation is applied directly to the SVG itself using `motion.svg`.

```tsx
<motion.svg
  fill="none"
  viewBox="0 0 16 16"
  className={cn("size-4", className)}
>
```

Instead of using a regular SVG element with additional CSS keyframe animations, this component uses `motion.svg`, which provides built-in animation capabilities such as `initial`, `animate`, and `transition` props.

## Styling and Reusability

The SVG uses currentColor, allowing it to inherit text color from its parent.
Sizing is handled via Tailwind `size-4` by default, and the optional `className` prop allows full customization.

## Wave Animation Logic

The waving motion is created using a sequence of rotation values combined with subtle scaling:

```ts
animate={{
  rotate: [0, 20, -10, 20, -5, 0],
  scale: [1, 1.2, 1.2, 1],
}}
```

Instead of a single rotation, multiple angles are used to simulate a natural hand wave.
The slight scale increase adds a sense of energy without being distracting.

## Timing and Loop Behavior

```ts
transition={{
  duration: 1,
  repeat: Infinity,
  times: [0, 0.2, 0.8, 1],
  repeatDelay: 2,
  ease: "easeInOut",
}}
```

- 1 second per wave
- Infinite looping
- 2 second pause between waves
- Smooth easing for a natural feel

This timing ensures the animation feels friendly and intentional, not repetitive or noisy.

## Live Demo: How It Feels in the UI

<Preview>
  <WaveIcon className="size-6" />
</Preview>

## Here’s the complete code

<include cwd lang="tsx">
  ./components/icons/wave-icon.tsx
</include>

Notice the `use client` directive at the top of the file. This is necessary because
Motion uses browser APIs that are unavailable in server components.

## Final Thoughts

This hand-wave animation is a small but intentional detail designed to add personality without distraction. By combining Motion’s animation control with Tailwind’s styling flexibility, the result is a clean, expressive UI component suitable for real-world production use.

Micro-interactions like this can make interfaces feel more approachable—and often, that’s what users remember most.
